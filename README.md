# TP-Link Router Administration Panel

![Github repo license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/KagamineP/tplrap) ![Github repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/code-size/KagamineP/tplrap)

This program was created to simplify the login to the admin panel on [TP-Link](https://tp-link.com/) routers. This program requires a connection to the router via Wi-Fi or LAN. This program uses [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp), so the program loads the page http://tplinkwifi.net/ (works only on TP-Link routers). Ie, this program is a shortcut to access the administration panel. 

Auto-update function based on [AutoUpdater.NET](https://github.com/ravibpatel/AutoUpdater.NET).

Known Issues
------------
There is no way to access the admin panel on older versions of routers. 
Workaround: Use the browser you use.

System requirements
-------------------
Operating system from Windows 7 to Windows 10  
.Net Framework 4.7.2  
Visual C++ 2015-2019

Build dependencies
------------------
To build this program you need to install CefSharp from NuGet.
